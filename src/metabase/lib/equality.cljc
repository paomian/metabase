(defn find-closest-matches-for-refs
  "For each ref in `needles`, find the ref in `haystack` that it most closely matches. This is meant to power things
  like [[metabase.lib.breakout/breakoutable-columns]] which are supposed to include `:breakout-position` for columns
  that are already present as a breakout; sometimes the column in the breakout does not exactly match what MLv2 would
  have generated. So try to figure out which column it is referring to.

  This first looks for each matching ref with a strict comparison, then in increasingly less-strict comparisons until it
  finds something that matches. This is mostly to work around bugs like #31482 where MLv1 generated queries with
  `:field` refs that did not include join aliases even though the Fields came from joined Tables... we still know the
  Fields are the same if they have the same IDs.

  The three-arity version can also find matches between integer Field ID references like `[:field {} 1]` and
  equivalent string column name field literal references like `[:field {} \"bird_type\"]` by resolving Field IDs using
  a `metadata-providerable` (something that can be treated as a metadata provider, e.g. a `query` with a
  MetadataProvider associated with it). This is the ultimately hacky workaround for totally busted legacy queries.

  Note that this currently only works when `needles` contain integer Field IDs. The `haystack` refs must have string
  literal column names. Luckily we currently don't have problems with MLv1/legacy queries accidentally using string
  `:field` literals where it shouldn't have been doing so.

  Returns a list parallel to `needles`, where each element is either nil (no match) or the index of the most closely
  matching ref in `haystack`."
